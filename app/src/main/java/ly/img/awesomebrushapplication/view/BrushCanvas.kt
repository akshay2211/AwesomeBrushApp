        // points. The control points are calculated based on the previous point and the next point, which
        // means that you always have to draw one point in the past.
        //
        // Imagine the user is drawing on screen and as the user drags his finger around on the screen, you receive
        // multiple points. The last point that you receive is point P4. The point that you received prior to that 
        // is point P3 and so on. Now in order to get a smooth drawing, you'll want to draw a cubic Bezier curve between
        // P2 and P3 through control points that are calculated using P1 and P4.
        // 
        // This also means that in order to actually reach the last point that you've received (P4 in the above scenario),
        // you'll have to draw once more **after** the user's finger has already left the screen.
        //
        // If the user only taps on the screen instead of dragging their finger around, you should draw a point.

        // The algorithm below implements the described behavior from above. You only need to fetch the appropriate
        // points from your custom data structure.

        // Note: this should also be replaced by your custom data structure that stores points.
